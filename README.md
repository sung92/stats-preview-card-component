## Overview

One card component.

Used Sass for styling.

Mobile-first styling.

Used BEM for class names and thought a good HTML structure first before styling it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- [CSS reset](https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) - To baseline cross-browser styles

### What I learned

- To use "em" for vertical margins on elements and "rem" for paddings and media-queries (the justification for this: https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1155795643391025152/1155823071723274250)
- To use mix-blend-mode CSS property together with a background-color on the image.
- Accesibility for the list items(optional) using *role="listitem"* to the "li" elements and *role="list"* to the "ul" element (recommended for list containers).

### Continued development

My main focus is still to create a well-structured HTML first. Also to keep implementing what I've learned for this project. Next step, I would like to use a better "button" and "a" classnames for styling the base first (.btn, .link), and then use a modifier for each specific button (btn--primary, btn--secondary, etc &&  link--primary, link--secondary, etc).
Additionally, I would like to take into account what I've learned about "rem" and "em" for the next challenge.
